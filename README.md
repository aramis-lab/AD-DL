## About the project

This repository hosts the code source for reproducible experiments on
**automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using anatomical MRI
data**.
It allows training autoencoders and convolutional neural networks.
The journal version of the paper describing this work is available
[here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694).

## Pretrained models

Some pretrained CNNs can be obtained here:
<https://zenodo.org/record/3491003>.
These models were obtained during the experiments for publication.
